This project was put together as an exploritory project to learn the fundimentals of writing a text-editor. 

What I learned:
  - Gained familiarity with terminal signals.
  - Learned how to implement filemanagement in C.
  - Gained some insight into parsing text-data.
  - Became much more rounded in use of structures and pointers.
